I love horror movies since I was young. I didn't fear nothing. there was one thing i feared a little child's red monster, Elmo. I don't" know what why but something was off about him. I loved "child's Play", and "the exorcist" they are not that scary man, but Elmo was some other he like a uncanny monster. I don't fear him now and I Joke about it with my friends, I find it so funny to be a big fan of horror and a silly little red monster that what scared me.
