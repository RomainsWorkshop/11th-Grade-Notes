What's it like living in this town. Debates about race, racial hate crimes, lack of authority. Even with the 2 police officers in this town there is no robbery just hate. the three stores in town always has someone complaining about a coupon, Unable to find something, or even prices. The only time we come together is when there is a lottery or a fare. Today I saw Johnny Attacking a young black kid for stealing a chocolate bar. I tried to convince him to stop he told me it to back out of it and it none of my business. It hurts to see someone of the other race is treated poorly and I can't do nothing. soon as Johnny left I bought the kid a chocolate bar. "Thank you sir" The kid said to me with broses all over him and his shirt ripped, In the end he still smiled at me.
