I don't gamble but i used to play on a lot of pay to win Minecraft server. I don't doop but there one server which was kind of over the top pay to win, so me and my friend found a doop in the server and went crazy, We did get banned but it was fun. lead to now one of the mods on that server was a mod in another server some other guy was doping and he traded with me. I was accused by that mod i made appeals but this guy still was not getting it till the found the real guy man looking back at it, it was funny.
