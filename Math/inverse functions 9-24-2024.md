for a linear function and it inverse 
	- The inputs and output in the table are reversed
	- The x- and y-coordinates of point are reversed 
	- the slopes are reciprocals
	- The graphs are reflections over the y = x line
To find the inverse of a equation, you need to 
	- Switch the x and y variables
	- Solve for y
Example: to find the inverse f y = $y = {2/3}x -4$
