A Polynomial function is a sum of terms in a the same variable with whole number exponents and real coefficients. the degree of the Polynomial is the exponent in the highest-powered term of the function/
- Degree 1 Polynomial (Linear Function): $y = 3x -1$
- Degree 1 Polynomial (Quadratic Function): $y = 3x[2] - 2x +9 $
- Degree 1 Polynomial (Cubbic  Function): $y = 3x - 1$
- Degree 1 Polynomial (Linear Function): $y = 3x -1$
