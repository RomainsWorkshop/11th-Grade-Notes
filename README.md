# This notebook is based on the obsidion software: https://obsidian.md/download
- This supports Linux, Mac, Window, Android, and Ios
- If you need me to commit a resent version for and reason email at rjeanty2018@gmail.com
- If you know git Just clone and pull from time to time
- If you don't know git You can use git gui apps
  - GitHub Desktop: https://github.com/apps/desktop
  - GitKraken Desktop: https://www.gitkraken.com/git-client
- I don't use the gui's and use my command line for git I never see the point of a gui personly but it must make it easy to others
- You don't need to know git just download it as a zip unzip and open folder as vault
- I love this software when it comes to note taking it clean and good for any managementðŸ˜Š
# This is also funny you could read them off of the github website because github support md file display
