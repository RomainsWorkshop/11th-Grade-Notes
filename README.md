This notebook is based on the obsidion software: https://obsidian.md/download
- THis supports linux, mac, window, android, and ios
- If you need me to commit a resent version for and reason email at rjeanty2018@gmail.com
- if you know git you don't need to know git just download it as a zip unzip and open folder as vault
- I love this software when it comes to note taking it clean and good for any managementðŸ˜Š
Thid is also funny you could read them off of the github website because github support md file display
